# Sprint Milestones

## Description

Milestones refer to the various tests that students undertake at the end of each sprint/module. 
Scholarship funds can only be withdrawn when students reach these pre-defined learning milestones, at the end of every module.

## Overview

This repository outlines the procedures for project submission, the grading criteria based on provided rubrics, the minimum threshold for each assessment component, and the determination of pass or fail grades. 

It also specifies the role of oral exams in the evaluation process and how they contribute to individual student progression.

## Project Submission:
### 1.1 Google Form:

Students are required to submit their projects through a Google Form.
The Google Form includes fields for students to provide necessary details and submit links to their GitHub repositories.

Students must complete all mandatory fields and ensure that the GitHub repository links are accurate and accessible.

Stakeholders can refer to the sheets linked at the bottom to verify the status of submissions and track the progress of grading.

## Grading Criteria:
### 2.1 Project Rubrics:

Rubrics outline the specific criteria and expectations for evaluating each project.
The rubrics cover various aspects such as code quality, functionality, documentation, creativity, and adherence to project requirements.


### 2.2 Oral Exam Rubrics:

- Rubric Development:

The rubrics for oral exams are designed to assess the student's understanding, comprehension, and ability to articulate the concepts and decisions made in their project.

The rubrics are developed in alignment with the learning objectives and assessment goals of the module or course.

- Evaluation Criteria:

The rubrics for oral exams may include various aspects such as clarity of explanations, depth of understanding, ability to defend choices made in the project, effective communication skills, and overall comprehension of the project's code and concepts.

- Scoring and Assessment:

Each aspect within the rubrics is assigned a specific score or rating scale to provide a structured evaluation process.

The examiner evaluates the student's performance during the oral exam based on the rubrics, assigning scores or ratings for each criterion.

- Contribution to Final Evaluation:

The scores obtained from the oral exams, as per the rubrics, contribute significantly to the final evaluation of the student's performance.
The oral exam scores are factored in along with the project scores to determine individual student progression within the module.

## Grading Process:
### 3.1 Examiner Evaluation:

The examiner, is responsible for grading and evaluating the submitted work.
The examiner reviews the project code, documentation, and any additional materials provided by the students.
The examiner compares the work against the rubrics to assess its compliance with the grading criteria.

## Minimum Threshold:
### 4.1 Pass Mark Grade:

The minimum passing grade for each project is 80% according to the rubric.

If the project's overall score falls below 80%, the project will be considered a failure.

## Oral Exams:
### 5.1 Purpose:

Oral exams serve as a primary determinant for individual student progression.

They assess the student's understanding of the code delivered in their project and their ability to explain and defend their work.

### 5.2 Process:

Oral exams are conducted for each student.

The oral exam evaluates the student's knowledge, comprehension, and ability to articulate the concepts and decisions made in their project.

The oral exam contributes significantly to the final evaluation of the student's performance.

## Group Projects (Module 2-4):
### 6.1 Group Evaluation:
Module 2-4 projects are completed in groups of four students.

The group, as a whole, is evaluated based on the project's overall score, which is calculated by considering the individual scores of each group member.

### 6.2 Pass/Fail as a Group:

The group project is considered a pass if the project's overall score meets or exceeds the minimum passing grade of 80%.
If the project's overall score falls below 80%, the group project will be considered a failure.

## Individual Progression:
### 7.1 Oral Exam Importance:
Individual student progression is primarily determined by the outcome of the oral exam.
Regardless of the group project result, a student can progress if they demonstrate sufficient understanding and competency during the oral exam.
